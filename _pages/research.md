My main goal is to unravel the neural mechanisms underlying human visual perception and to build computational methods that can decode brain signals. 
By doing so, my work bridges cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence, with a strong focus on neurotechnology and brain-computer interfacing (BCI).

## Research Vision
I hold several ambitions:
* to understand the brain: how neural mechanisms give rise to perception and cognition;
* to develop machine learning algorithms capable of dealing with the challenges of neural data; 
* to translate fundamental findings into real-world neurotechnological applications that benefit society.

A central part of my research philosophy is a commitment to open, transparent, and collaborative science. 
I actively promote the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and advocates for sharing code, experimental materials, and raw or curated datasets whenever ethically and legally possible. 
By building research workflows around reproducibility and open-source tools, I aim to accelerate scientific progress, improve replicability, and enable others to build directly on prior work rather than reinvent it. 
I view open science not just as a best practice, but as a responsibility, ensuring that publicly funded research produces reliable, reusable knowledge for the broader scientific community and society

## Research Themes & Applications
At least three common themes are reflected throughout my research.

### Perception & Awareness
I study how the brain processes sensory information, how perceptual experiences arise from neural activity, and how these mechanisms can be captured in computational models. 
In particular, my work focuses on how the predictive brain integrates top-down expectations with bottom-up sensory signals. 
For example, I have investigated how the visual system fills in missing information during occlusion, a phenomenon known as amodal completion. 
I have also examined how patterns of fixational eye movements (i.e., those during attempted fixation) systematically change as a function of the sensory input. 

### Neural Encoding & Decoding
I use insights from human brain function to inspire new stimulation protocols and analysis methods, and, in turn, use these methodological advances to refine our understanding of the brain.
On the stimulation side, I work on the noise-tagging protocol, which presents noise-like, mutually dissimilar stimuli that make it easier to distinguish and decode individual stimulus representations from recorded brain activity.
On the analysis side, I develop machine-learning algorithms capable of identifying the attended stimulus from extremely noisy and very brief segments of neural data. 
To do this, I use both encoding and decoding approaches (i.e., forward and backward models) to capture how stimuli are represented in the brain and how those representations can be reconstructed. 

### Neurotechnology & Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI)
By integrating neuroscientific insights with algorithmic innovation, I develop systems that can decode mental states from brain activity, enabling communication or control directly through neural signals. Such brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) hold particular promise for individuals with paralysis or severe motor impairments, offering new ways to interact with the world when traditional forms of movement or speech are not possible.
