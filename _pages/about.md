I aim to unravel the neural mechanisms underlying human perception and develop sophisticated machine learning methods to model and decode signals from the human brain. 
Combining these two efforts (i.e., artificial intelligence and cognitive neuroscience), I work towards assistive devices by advancing neurotechnological systems including (non-invasive) brain-computer interfacing, for instance for communication and control.
