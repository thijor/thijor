## PyNTBCI
The Python Noise-Tagging Brain-Computer interface (PyntBCI) library is a Python toolbox for the noise-tagging brain-computer interfacing (BCI) project developed at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.

It can be installed via pip:
```commandline
pip install pyntbci
```

Find the source on GitHub: [pyntbci](https://github.com/thijor/pyntbci)

## dp-cvep
Th dp-cvep repository contains documentation and resources to set up a demo of a brain-computer interface (BCI) for communication, that uses the code-modulated visual evoked potential (c-VEP). This setup makes use of the [Dareplane](https://bsdlab.github.io/Dareplane/main.html) platform for closed-loop experiments.

It can be cloned from GitHub:
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/thijor/dp-cvep.git
```
After cloning it, run one of the Python setup scripts. For instance, for an ANT Neuro EEG amplifier:
```commandline
python setup_cvep_demo_antneuro.py
```
